This document is a reference to the project hosted in this repository in gitlab - https://world-tsp-ci-assurance.is.echonet/gitlab/Frontend/tsp-ng-template[Frontend - tsp-ng-template] 


## How to Run it

This project was generated with https://github.com/angular/angular-cli[Angular CLI] version 1.0.0.

### Develpment Server

****
Run `*ng serve*` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 
****

or  

****
Run with proxy `*npm start*` for a dev server with proxy to API. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
****

### Code scaffolding

****
Run `*ng generate component component-name*` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.
****

### Build  

****
Run `*ng build*` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `*dist/*` directory. Use the `*-prod*` flag for a production build.  
****

### Build docs  

****
Run `*npm run build:docs*` to build the project's docs. The build artifacts will be stored in the `documentation/` directory.  
****

### Running unit tests  

****
Run `*npm test*` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).  
****

### Running end-to-end tests  

****
Run `*ng e2e*` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `*ng serve*`.
****

### Further help  

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `*ng help*` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

### Action

[NOTE]

( functional layer )
----
src
|-- app
|   |-- action
----

**Actions** are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the __only__ source of information for the store. You send them to the store using http://redux.js.org/docs/api/Store.html#dispatch[``store.dispatch()``]. 

Actions are plain JavaScript objects. Actions must have a ``type`` property that indicates the type of action being performed. Types should typically be defined as string constants.

### Effects

[NOTE]
part of https://github.com/ngrx/store[@ngrx/store] +
( functional layer )
----
src
|-- app
|   |-- effects
----

**Effects**  is a middleware layer that aims to make side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) in https://github.com/ngrx/store[@ngrx/store] applications easier and better.

The mental model is that a Effects layer is like a separate thread in your application that's solely responsible for side effects. This Effect layer is the only bridge between components and services, it has access to the full store application state and it can dispatch reducer actions as well.

### Models

----
src
|-- app
|   |-- models
----

**Models**  Represents a interface/class thats provide a great way to enforce consistency across objects which is useful in a variety of scenarios. In addition to consistency, interfaces can also be used to ensure that proper data is passed to properties, constructors and functions. Finally, interfaces also provide additional flexibility in an application and make it more loosely coupled.

### Modules

----
src
|-- app
|   |-- modules
|   |   |--tsp-ui
|   |   |--login
|   |   |--containers
----

**Modules** Modules help to organize an application into cohesive group of components, directives, pipes and services that are related, in such a way that can be combined with other modules to create an application.

The module itself is a directory that contains many files and subdirectories:

* 1 file for the module description itself
* 1 file for the module routing rules
* N sub-directories: One sub-directory per component inside the module

**NAME CONVENTION**
----
MODULES_NAME.module.ts
MODULES_NAME-routing.module.ts
----

**tsp-ui** - It contains most common components throughout the application. Such as the site warper, or the language selector.
This module contains 'dummy' components and contains no routes 

**login** - Contains user-related components. Login/Authentication, Registration, Profile Area etc.
This module has its own routes. Routes must have the prefix `user`. Ex: `user/login`.

**containers** - This module contains the business components. Separated by areas. (Aka pages). +
Mandatory in this module that all components must extend the `*Base Component*`. +
Each route must contain a component with the same name. The route / component represents a page of the application with its own deeplink

### Reducer

[NOTE]

( functional layer )
----
src
|-- app
|   |-- reducer
----

**Reducer** job's is to tell how the application's state changes. The reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.

It's called a reducer because it's the type of function you would pass to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce[``Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue)``]. It's very important that the reducer stays pure. Things you should **never** do inside a reducer:

*   Mutate its arguments;
*   Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions;
*   Call non-pure functions, e.g. ``Date.now()`` or ``Math.random()``.


Remember that the reducer must be pure. **Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises. No side effects. No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation.**

### Services

----
src
|-- app
|   |-- services
----

**Services** is basically any set of functionality to make calls to the 'outside'. All calls to an API must be centralized in this folder

All services must extend the `base.services.ts`

== Store 

https://github.com/ngrx/store[@ngrx/store] powered state management for Angular applications, inspired by Redux.

This layer (yellow in the diagram of the project architect, point 3), is a predictable state container. It helps you write applications that behave consistently. +
To achieve this result the use of functional program is essential


=== Functional Program
**Functional programming** (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing **pure functions**, avoiding **shared state,** **mutable data, **and **side-effects**. Functional programming is **declarative** rather than **imperative**, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

Functional code tends to be more concise, more predictable, and easier to test than imperative or object oriented code
